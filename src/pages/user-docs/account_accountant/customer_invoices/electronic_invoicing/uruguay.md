# Odoo electronic invoicing in Uruguay

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally
compliant e-invoicing solutions tailored to meet Uruguay\'s regulatory
requirements and fully compatible with the guidelines established by the
[Dirección General Impositiva
(DGI)](https://www.gub.uy/direccion-general-impositiva/).

## Legal framework for e-invoicing in Uruguay

Uruguay has mandated electronic invoicing under the
`CFE (Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico)`
system, which applies to most businesses to promote tax transparency and
streamline financial transactions. Key elements include:

- **Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico**: A mandatory e-invoice format
  required for B2B, B2C, and
  `B2G (business-to-government)`
  transactions, fully compliant with `DGI (Dirección
  General Impositiva)`\'s technical
  standards.
- **Integration with DGI**: All
  `CFE (Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico)`
  must be submitted to the
  `DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)`
  for validation. Upon approval, the `CFE
  (Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico)`
  receives a unique identification code and authorization for issuance.
- **XML Format**: Uruguay mandates the use of XML as the standard format
  for e-invoices, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with
  various systems.
- **Adoption Timeline**: E-invoicing is mandatory for most businesses,
  with specific deadlines for smaller enterprises to transition into the
  system.
