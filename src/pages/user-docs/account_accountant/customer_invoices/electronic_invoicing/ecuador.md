## Legal framework for e-invoicing in Ecuador

Ecuador has implemented mandatory electronic invoicing for most
businesses aimed to enhance tax compliance and transparency. Key
elements include:

- **Factura Electr√≥nica**: All businesses must issue electronic invoices
  in XML format for B2B, B2C, and
  `B2G (business-to-government)`
  transactions, ensuring compliance with `SRI
  (Servicio de Rentas Internas)`\'s
  technical specifications.
- **Transmission Requirements**: E-invoices must be transmitted to the
  SRI within 24 hours of issuance.
- **Record Storage**: E-invoices, including the
  `SRI (Servicio de Rentas Internas)`\'s
  acceptance messages, must be stored for a minimum of seven years.
