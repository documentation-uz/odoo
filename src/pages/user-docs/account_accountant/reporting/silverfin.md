# Silverfin integration

[Silverfin](https://www.silverfin.com) is a third-party service provider
that offers a cloud platform for accountants.

Odoo and Silverfin provide an integration to automate the
synchronization of data.

## Configuration

To configure this integration, you need to input the following data into
your Silverfin account:

- user\'s email address
- `Odoo API key `
- URL of the Odoo database
- name of your Odoo database

### Odoo API key 

You can create Odoo external API keys either
`for a single database ` (hosting: Odoo Online, On-premise, and Odoo.sh) or
`for all databases managed by a single user
` (hosting: Odoo
Online).

::: warning

\- These API keys are personal and provide full access to your user
account. Store it securely. - You can copy the API key only at its
creation. It is not possible to retrieve it later. - If you need it
again, create a new API key (and delete the old one).

#### Per database 

To add an API key to a **single** database, connect to the database,
enable the `developer
mode `, click on the user
menu, and then `My Profile` /
`Preferences`. Under the
`Account Security` tab, click on
`New API
Key`, confirm your password, give a
descriptive name to your new key, and copy the API key.

#### For all databases (fiduciaries) 

To add an API key to **all** databases managed by a single user at the
same time **(the easiest method for fiduciaries)**, navigate to [Odoo\'s
website](https://www.odoo.com) and sign in with your administrator
account. Next, open [your account security settings in developer
mode](https://www.odoo.com/my/security?debug=1), click on
`New API Key`, confirm your password,
give a descriptive name to your new key, and copy the new API key.

::: tip

Open the [database manager](https://www.odoo.com/my/databases) to view
all databases that will be linked to the single API key.
