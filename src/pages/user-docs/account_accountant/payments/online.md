To make it more convenient for your customers to pay the invoices you
issue, you can activate the **Invoice Online Payment** feature, which
adds a *Pay Now* button on their **Customer Portal**. This allows your
customers to see their invoices online and pay directly with their
favorite payment method, making the payment process much easier.

## Configuration

Make sure your
`payment providers are correctly configured `.

::: tip

By default,
\"`Wire Transfer `\" is the only payment provider activated, but you still have
to fill out the payment details.
::::

To activate the Invoice Online Payment, go to
`Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣
Settings ‣ Customer Payments`,
enable **Invoice Online Payment**, and click on *Save*.

## Customer Portal

After issuing the invoice, click on *Send & Print* and send the invoice
by email to the customer. They will receive an email with a link that
redirects them to the invoice on their **Customer Portal**.
