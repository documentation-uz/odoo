# Units of measure

In some cases, handling products in different units of measure is
necessary. For example, a business can buy products from a country that
uses the metric system, and then sell those products in a country that
uses the imperial system. In that case, the business needs to convert
the units.

Another case for unit conversion is when a business buys products in a
big pack from a supplier, and then sells those products in individual
units.

Odoo can be set up to use different *units of measure (UoM)* for one
product.

## Configuration

To use different units of measure in Odoo, first go to
`Inventory app ‣
Configuration ‣ Settings`, and
under the `Products` section,
activate the `Units of Measure`
setting. Then, click `Save`.

## Units of measure categories

After enabling the *Units of Measure* setting, view the default units of
measure categories in
`Inventory app ‣ Configuration ‣ UoM Categories`. The category is important for unit conversion;
Odoo can convert a product\'s units from one unit to another **only** if
both units belong to the same category.

![Set units of measure categories.](uom/category.png)

Each units of measure category has a reference unit. The reference unit
is highlighted in blue in the `Uom`
column of the `Units of Measure Categories` page. Odoo uses the reference unit as a base for any
new units.

To create a new unit, first select the correct category from the
`Units of Measure
Categories` page. For example, to
sell a product in a box of six units, click the `Unit` category line. Then, on the category page that appears,
click `Add a line` in the
`Units of Measure` tab. Then, in the
`Unit of Measure` field, title the
new unit, such as [Box of 6], then in the
`Type` field, select the appropriate
size reference, such as
`Bigger than the reference Unit of Measure`.

If applicable, enter a `UNSPSC Category`, which is a globally recognized [code managed by
GS1](https://www.unspsc.org/), that **must** be purchased in order to
use.

In the `Ratio` field, enter how many
individual units are in the new
`UoM (Unit of Measure)`, such as
[6.00000] when using the example of the [6-Pack]
(since a box of six is six times *bigger* than the reference unit,
[1.00000]).

![Convert products from one unit to another as long as they belong to the same category.](uom/convert-products-by-unit.png)

## Specify a product\'s units of measure

To set units of measure on a product, first go to
`Inventory app ‣ Products ‣
Products` and select a product
to open its product form page.

In the `General Information` tab,
edit the `Unit of Measure` field to
specify the unit of measure that the product is sold in. The specified
unit is also the unit used to keep track of the product\'s inventory and
internal transfers.

Edit the `Purchase UoM` field to
specify the unit of measure that the product is purchased in.

## Unit conversion 

Odoo automatically converts unit measurements when products have
different `UoMs (Units of
Measure)` and purchase
`UoMs (Units of Measure)`.

This occurs in various scenarios, including:

1.  `Vendor orders `: purchase `UoM (Unit of Measure)` on purchase orders (POs) converts to
    `UoM (Unit of Measure)` on internal
    warehouse documents
2.  `Automatic replenishment `: generates `POs (Purchase Orders)` when the stock levels of a product (tracked in
    `UoM (Unit of Measure)`) dips below a
    certain level. But, the `POs (Purchase Orders)` are created using the purchase
    `UoM (Unit of Measure)`
3.  `Sell products `: if a different
    `UoM (Unit of Measure)` is used on
    the sales order (SO), the quantity is converted to the warehouse\'s
    preferred `UoM (Unit of Measure)` on
    the delivery order

### Buy products in the purchase UoM 

When creating a new request for quotation (RFQ) in the *Purchase* app,
Odoo automatically uses the product\'s specified purchase unit of
measure. If needed, manually edit the `UoM` value on the
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`.

After the `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`
is confirmed into a `PO (Purchase Order)`, click the `Receipt`
smart button at the top of the `PO (Purchase Order)`.

Odoo automatically converts the purchase unit of measure into the
product\'s sales/inventory unit of measure, so the
`Demand` column of the delivery
receipt shows the converted quantity.

::: example
When the product\'s purchase `UoM` is
[Box of 6], and its sales/inventory unit of measure is
[Units], the `PO (Purchase Order)` shows the quantity in boxes of six, and the receipt (and
other internal warehouse documents) shows the quantity in units.



An order of three quantities is placed using the purchase
"UoM": Box of 6.




Upon warehouse receipt, the recorded quantities are in the
internal "Unit of Measure": Units.

:::

### Replenishment 

A request for quotation for a product can also be generated directly
from the product form using the `Replenish` button.

After clicking `Replenish`, a
replenish assistant box pops up. The purchase unit of measure can be
manually edited in the `Quantity`
field, if needed. Then, click `Confirm` to create the
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`.

::: warning

A `PO (Purchase Order)` can **only** be
automatically generated if at least **one** vendor is listed in the
product form\'s `Purchase` tab.
::::

![Click Replenish button to manually replenish.](uom/replenish.png)

Navigate to the created `PO (Purchase Order)` by clicking the `Forecasted` smart button on the product form. Scroll down to the
`Forecasted Inventory` section, and
in the `Requests
for quotation` line, click the
`RFQ (Request for Quotation)` reference
number to open the draft `RFQ (Request for Quotation)`. If necessary, the purchase
`UoM (Unit of Measure)` can be edited
directly on the `PO (Purchase Order)`.

### Sell in a different UoM 

When creating a new quotation in the *Sales* app, Odoo automatically
uses the product\'s specified unit of measure. If needed, the
`UoM` can be manually edited on the
quotation.

After the quotation is sent to the customer, and confirmed into a sales
order (SO), click the `Delivery`
smart button at the top of the `SO (Sales Order)`. Odoo automatically converts the unit of measure into the
product\'s inventory unit of measure, so the `Demand` column of the delivery shows the converted quantity.

For example, if the product\'s `UoM (Unit of Measure)` on the `SO (Sales Order)`
was changed to [Box of 6], but its inventory unit of measure
is [Units], the `SO (Sales Order)` shows the quantity in boxes of six, and the delivery shows
the quantity in units.
